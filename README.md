# Introduction to Text-Mining with Python 2020

## Introduction

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks used for teaching *'Introduction to Text-Mining with Python'*, 
a course in the Cambridge Digital Humanities (CDH) Learning programme 2020. This course is the first CDH 
course to be delivered completely online following the coronavirus outbreak and various modifications were 
made from last year's course to facilitate this.

The notebooks are designed to be worked on as self-paced materials in a 'flipped classroom' approach. They 
are also written as stand alone notebooks for anyone to follow and use as they wish.

**Status: Notebooks are in development. Material may be modified and added at any time.**
 
## Code Details

The notebooks should run on the following versions of Python:

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/)[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/)[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-381/)

The aim of the code in this repository is to show basic text-mining techniques 
to participants who are complete beginners to both text-mining and coding. 
As such, the notebooks are designed to be run as a teaching aid, not as a 
serious text analysis tool.

## Quick Start: Launch Notebooks Online

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mchesterkadwell/intro-to-text-mining-with-python-2020/master)

The easiest way to run the Jupyter notebooks in this repository is to click on the Binder button above. This will 
open in the same tab. To open in a new tab, right-click the button and choose 'Open in a new tab' or similar, 
depending on your browser. Binder will launch a virtual environment in your browser where you can open and run the 
notebooks without installing anything. 

Please note:

* Binder will shut down after about 10 minutes of inactivity i.e. if you don't interact with the notebooks for a while, 
such as running cells or opening files. You can simply open a new Binder to start again.
* Binder will not save any changes you make to the notebooks. To save changes you need to download the notebooks and 
run them on your own computer.
