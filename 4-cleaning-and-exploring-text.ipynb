    "_Tokenising_ means splitting a text into meaningful elements, such as words, sentences, or symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we are going to use [spaCy](https://spacy.io), a free and open-source Natural Language Processing (NLP) package. If you're interested in learning how to work with spaCy more broadly for a variety of NLP tasks I recommend the tutorial [Natural Language Processing with spaCy in Python](https://realpython.com/natural-language-processing-spacy-python/).\n",

    "#### spaCy and NLTK\n",
    "[NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) was the first open-source Python library for Natural Language Processing (NLP), originally released in 2001, and it is still a valuable tool for teaching and research. Much of the literature uses NLTK code in its examples, and researchers publish models, code and data sets for obscure languages designed for use with NLTK.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in using NLTK for the tasks presented in these notebooks instead of spaCy, please see last year's notebooks: https://github.com/mchesterkadwell/intro-to-text-mining-with-python\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK has been overtaken in efficiency and ease of use by other more modern libraries, such as [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/), which uses machine learning. It is designed to use less computer memory and split workloads across multiple processor cores (or even computers) so that it can handle very large corpora easily. It also has excellent documentation. However, out of the box, spaCy only has support for a limited set of modern languages. It is necessary to train your own models to use spaCy for your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am using spaCy in these notebooks to cut down on the amount of code I am presenting. The idea is to reduce the complexity so that beginners can concentrate on first principles.\n",
